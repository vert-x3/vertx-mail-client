# Vert.x SMTP client

A very preliminary version of a smtp client for vert.x.

Its missing a few bits to be really useful, the service interface only implements sending plain test mails yet.
The test classes shows how this could be used, the whole client is async and supports SSL, STARTTLS, SASL).

For an example, please take a look at the first bit of docu [src/main/asciidoc/java/index.adoc]

For questions about the project, please write a message on the vert.x google group or drop by on irc.
